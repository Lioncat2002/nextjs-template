ðŸ§© Project Architecture: Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)
This project follows the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture â€” a scalable, modular frontend methodology built for clarity, feature ownership, and long-term maintainability.

ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure Overview
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/           # Application entrypoints, routing, and layout composition
â”œâ”€â”€ config/        # Static global configuration (envs, themes, feature flags)
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/        # Reusable code: UI components, hooks, libs, styles, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ entities/      # Business-level models (User, Product, Order) with logic
â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/       # Complex UI units composed from entities/shared
â”œâ”€â”€ views/         # Page-level containers composed from widgets/entities



Layer Breakdown
app/
Responsible for routing, page-level layouts, and global app behavior.

Example: src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, route-level loading/error components.

App router (Next.js or React Router) bootstraps here.

config/
Global settings and constants.

Includes: env.ts, theme.ts, routes.ts, featureFlags.ts, etc.

Keeps configuration separate from logic and UI.

shared/
Reusable, low-level modules that can be used anywhere.

Includes:

ui/ â€“ atomic design components (e.g., Button, Card)

lib/ â€“ general-purpose utilities

hooks/ â€“ shared React hooks

styles/ â€“ Tailwind configs, global styles

api/ â€“ SDK wrappers or axios/ky clients

entities/
Core domain models with their own state, types, and logic.

Think of them as rich models (not plain types).

Examples:

User/: state (Zustand/Recoil), model types, server calls

Product/: fetch product list, handle product schema, etc.

widgets/
Mid-level composite UI units tied to business context.

Built using entities and shared components.

Examples:

UserProfileWidget/

ProductSearchBar/

CartSummary/

views/
Page or feature-specific containers composed from widgets/entities.

Represents business "screens" or flows.

Examples:

DashboardView/

CheckoutFlowView/

LoginView/

ðŸ§  Why FSD?
Scales better than feature folders or MVC

Makes business domains explicit

Separates global UI concerns from business logic

Improves team collaboration and ownership

ðŸ§° Tips for Working in This Structure
Avoid deep nesting â€” shallow, flat modules per layer are preferred

Stick to boundaries â€” entities shouldn't import widgets, etc.

Use eslint-plugin-boundaries for layer isolation enforcement
